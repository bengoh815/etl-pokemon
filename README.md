# ðŸ§¬ PokÃ©mon ETL Pipeline

A simple ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that fetches PokÃ©mon data from the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/), filters based on base experience, and saves the result as a CSV file.

This project is designed as an introductory ETL example for learning data engineering concepts using Python.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Extracts a list of PokÃ©mon from the public API
- Fetches detailed info for each PokÃ©mon
- Filters PokÃ©mon with `base_experience > 100`
- Transforms and structures the data into a clean format
- Loads the result into a CSV file
